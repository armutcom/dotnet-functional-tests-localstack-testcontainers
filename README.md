# dotnet-functional-tests-localstack-testcontainers
Sample project for 2021 DotNetConf http://www.dotnetkonf.com/ 

# Getting Started

Run this command before running tests

```
docker pull lambci/lambda:dotnetcore3.1
```

All other docker images will be downloaded by tests. Therefore, the first run may take a long time.
